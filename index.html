<!-- hola. the following dollop of code is the correct basic structure for html, as explained in class-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Intro to Web Dev</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- heyo. the following line uses the style attribute (i made it a centered heading in italics) to give the text color (which, in hex value, is #f5bab9) and to give the text a 30pt font size. the text reads "woohoo~"-->
    <i> <h1 style="color: #f5bab9; font-size: 50px; text-align: center;">woohoo~</h1> </i>
    <!-- hey. this next line inserts an image of a cute puppy-->
    <p style="text-align: center"> <img src="https://en.bcdn.biz/Images/2016/11/15/776342f0-86f5-4522-84c9-a02d6b11c766.jpg"> </p>
    <!-- same as line 10, only now i changed it to not be a heading or in the center, as well as the colour (#b9cff5) and what the text reads ("look at this cute puppy!")-->
    <p> <i style="color: #b9cff5; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">look at this cute puppy!</i> </p>
  </body>

<!-- honestly i don't know if i did this right (i'm 100% new to coding) but i hope i did okay! peace.-->
